// A reference in C++ is a method of creating an alias to a variable, where
// these aliases refer to the same data in memory. References are useful for
// keeping track of state, passing arguments into functions, and for general
// performance improvements. In general, it is important to understand
// references to do well in this class.

// Includes std::cout (printing) for demo purposes.
#include <iostream>

// A function that takes an int and adds 1000 to it.
// pass a copy
void add_thousand(int a){ a = a + 1000; }


// A function that takes an int reference and adds 3 to it.
// pass by reference
void add_three(int &a) { a = a + 3; }

int main() {
  // Take this expression. Note that b has type int& (int reference),
  // since it is a reference to a. This means that a and b both refer to the
  // same data. You can declare references by setting your variables type via
  // the single ampersand syntax.
  int a = 10;
  int &b = a;
  // b is a reference to a, so if we change b, then a will also change. For example,
  b = 20;

  // As stated, if we try to print b, we will get 20.
  std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;

  // try to add 1000 to a
  add_thousand(a);
  std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;

  // References can also be passed into functions. Take the function add_three,
  // which takes in an int reference and adds 3 to it. If we call this function,
  // on a, since a is being taken as a reference, then a's value in the caller
  // context will change value.
  add_three(a);
  std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;

  return 0;
